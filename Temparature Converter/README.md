This project aims to create a temperature converter . The project includes three inputs for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperature formats. When you change any of these inputs, for example, if you choose 100 degrees Celsius, you will see the equivalent Celsius value in Fahrenheit and Kelvin formats. Additionally, if you change one input, you will see a real-time change inside the other inputs. For instance, changing the Fahrenheit input to 100 degrees will show you that it is equal to 37 degrees Celsius and 311 Kelvin.
